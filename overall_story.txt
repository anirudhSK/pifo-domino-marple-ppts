1. Motivate why we need programmability.

2. Where we fell short: we either had programmability or performance, not both.

3. The vision: programmability + performance, i.e., no compromise.

4. Concrete question: what's the instruction set or RISC for this programmable
router?

5. But why bother? Why not use x86 instructions?
   --> Variable latency is at odds with determinism.
   --> Too general and expensive for our purpose.
   --> Use this to introduce the pipeline as well.

6. Here we answer this question for two specific classes of router
functionality: scheduling and stateful data-plane algorithms.
If there's time, I'll get into measurement.
(Try doing PIFO before Domino. It's a simpler idea to explain.)
