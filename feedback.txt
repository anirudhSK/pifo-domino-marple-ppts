1. Spend a bit more time on the demo.
2. What does the .sk file format look like? Spend a little more time on it.
3. More vision and approach at the beginning.
4. More future work at the end.
8. Avoid the term overhead. People seem to interpret it as: you take out a lot
of existing stuff, you add back a lot of new stuff. new - existing = overhead. I
n reality, we only need a little bit of additional stuff; we don't need to overh
al the old stuff, which is what overhead seems to imply.
9. Differentiate against FPGA-based high-level synthesis: target LUTs, not atoms,
much more fine grained, can do anything at the cost of lower performance.
10. What about an architecture with accelerators: It's a possibility, but we don't
know exactly what accelerators we will need.
